      <h1>meta world project</h1>
      <p>create a 130x130px image (jpg, png, gif) for the meta world space.</p>

      <div style="width:130px; height:130px; background:#373b63;"></div>
      <p>this can be whatever you want. think of this as an emblem or a doorway to your world… what would that look like? maybe it is a shape, a picture, a word, an animation, transparent, or solid...</p>
      <p>the doorways will link to your projects. where each doorway goes will depend on your project. if your project exists as a website it will go there. if it exists offline it can point to wherever you have your project documented—possibly: your blog, a separate web space for documentation of the project, or you could send me your documentation and I could make a quick page to host the images.</p>
      <p>we will also want to come up with some name to collectively refer to the space… maybe a name for your cohort? sound off in the discord about this :-)</p>
      <p>a working draft of the space is <a href="../metaworld/index.html">here</a> so you can get an idea of how your doorway might relate to others in the space.</p>
