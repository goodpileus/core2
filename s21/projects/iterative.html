      <h1>iterative project</h1>
      <p>make 10 new iterations of your thek responses, using different mediums</p>
      <p>notes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>for each iteration, use a different medium than what you originally responded with</li>
        <li>you can iterate on 10 different responses or select a few to iterate on multiple times</li>
        <li>use at least 3 different/new mediums in your responses</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <p>scattered ideas for other mediums:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>found sound or recording</li>
        <li>short video</li>
        <li>photograph</li>
        <li>mixtape</li>
        <li>sculpture (from household objects?)</li>
        <li>postcard or some kind of letter</li>
        <li>text message</li>
        <li>comment on a youtube video</li>
        <li>knitting/sewing/embroidery...</li>
        <li>animation</li>
        <li><em>dance</em></li>
        <li>flower arrangement</li>
        <li>food!</li>
        <li>writing</li>
        <li>clothing</li>
        <li>jewelry/wearable</li>
        <li>painting</li>
        <li>meme</li>
        <li>collage</li>
        <li>small installation</li>
        <li>something else!</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>consider:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>how much of the original question or response do you want to preserve?</li>
        <li>use the original Thek question and your response as a jumping off point—don't let it trap you with its specificity... how far can you move away from the original question while maintaining some connection?</li>
        <li>what do you hide or keep to yourself?</li>
        <li>what is a way of responding to the question without words?</li>
        <li>what is a way of responding to the question with words that don’t seem to answer it to an outside observer but do for you?</li>
        <li>what is something that you would really like to learn how to make/work with? try to work with that!</li>
        <li>work with a medium that you really don’t like, but see if you can find a way to work with that is enjoyable or exciting...</li>
