      <p>Using the reading and resources as frameworks, re-work your visual research surface into a ‘portal’ for a speculative space. Use your research as a prompt to start developing a world-building direction.</p>
      <p>Consider the vibe, environment, philosophy, principles, drive, mechanics, vision of the world as inspired by your research. Focus on one part of your research to make things more manageable—like how Dunne and Raby chose forms of transportation to articulate their societies.</p>
      <p>Don't worry about envisioning an entire world—think of this as shining a small light into the space.</p>
      <p>notes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>generate a short (1 page) piece of writing that starts to develop the central concept for your world</li>
        <li>choose one element of the world to focus on to articulate the details of the world (a technology, specific geography, a ritual, etc.)</li>
        <li>include visual elements, like sketches/reference images, if that helps!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>other considerations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>remember</em> to maintain a personal connection to your speculative space!</li>
        <li>start to work your daily practice exercises into the framework you are setting up for your speculative space. use them as opportunities to explore and define the space even more.</li>
        <li>this is a creative exercise! you don't have to write an essay!</li>
        <li>take into consideration how you are writing about your space. are you writing from the top-down, describing things like you might find in an encyclopedia; or are you writing from a perspective within, as if you were a resident of that world?</li>
        <li>as always, have fun with this!</li>
      </ul>
