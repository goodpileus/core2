      <h1>portal project</h1>
      <p>Using the reading and resources as frameworks, re-work your visual research surface into a ‘portal’ for a speculative space. Use your research as a prompt to start developing a world-building direction.</p>
      <p>Think of this as a kind of pitch/proposal for your world. Consider the vibe, environment, philosophy, politics, principles, drives, mechanics, and vision of the world as inspired by your research. Try to focus on one aspect of the speculative space to make things more manageable—like how Dunne and Raby chose forms of transportation to articulate their societies.</p>
      <p>notes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>write a page long proposal for a world based on your research</li>
      </ul>
      <p>other considerations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>remember</em> to maintain a personal connection to your speculative space!</li>
        <li>start to work your daily practice exercises into the framework you are setting up for your speculative space. use them as opportunities to explore and define the space even more.</li>
        <li>take into consideration how you are writing about your space. are you writing from the top-down, describing things like you might find in an encyclopedia; or are you writing from a perspective within, as if you were a resident of that world?</li>
        <li>as always, have fun with this!</li>
      </ul>
